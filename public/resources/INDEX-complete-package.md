## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE

### The 6 Threat Categories for Sikh Families

| Threat | Scale | Primary Target | Key Risk |
|--------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Financial Fraud | $177K-$2.2M+ per victim | Elderly parents 60+ | Romance scams, government imposter calls |
| Identity Theft | 54% increase in complaints | Young adults, professionals | Fake profiles, phishing |
| Religious Hate & Harassment | 3rd most-targeted religious group in US | Activists, visible Sikhs | Death threats, doxxing, surveillance |
| Online Grooming | 500K predators active daily | Children 12-15 | Sextortion, CSAM production |
| School Bullying | 77.5% of Sikh students | Students with visible articles of faith | Physical assault, cyberbullying |
| Sexual Abuse | 40% less likely to report | Women/girls of all ages | Cultural silence, family isolation |

### Why Sikhs Are Uniquely Vulnerable

✅ **Visible Religious Identity** → Easy to target for hate, bullying, isolation  
✅ **Diaspora Family Structure** → Multi-generational households, remittances to India, cross-border exploitation  
✅ **Cultural Taboos** → Sex education absent, silence normalized, shame weaponized  
✅ **Pressure to Marry** → Especially women 30+, creates emotional vulnerability  
✅ **Language Barriers** → Punjabi/Hindi speakers can't monitor online activity, seek help  
✅ **Community Insularity** → Distrust of authorities, fear of reputation damage  
✅ **Documented Targeting** → BBC investigations show organized grooming gangs specifically target Sikh girls
