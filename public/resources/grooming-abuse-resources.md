## SUPPORT FOR PARENTS/GUARDIANS

### How to Talk to a Child About Being Groomed

**DO:**
- ✅ Believe the child
- ✅ Praise them for telling you ("I'm so glad you told me. That took courage.")
- ✅ Assure them: "This is not your fault. You did nothing wrong."
- ✅ Get them to safety immediately (remove device, talk to safe adult)
- ✅ Document what child says (write it down with date/time)
- ✅ Get professional help (therapist, counselor, law enforcement)
- ✅ Explain next steps simply ("We're going to talk to someone who can help")

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Blame the child ("Why did you send those photos?")
- ❌ Shame them ("You should have known better")
- ❌ Interrogate extensively (let professionals do detailed interviews)
- ❌ Delay seeking help
- ❌ Tell extended family if child's safety/privacy at risk

### Coping with Cultural Shame

**If You're Struggling with Family/Community Shame:**

Remember:
- Your child is a victim; abuse is not their fault
- Reporting does NOT bring shame to family—abuse does
- Keeping silent protects perpetrator, not family honor
- Healing requires breaking silence
- Many families have gone through this; you are not alone

**Seek Support:**
- Culturally-specific counselors (Al-Hurraya, MANAVI, community organizations)
- Support groups (in-person or online)
- Religious leaders who understand trauma and support survivors
