# Who's 125kCyberSingh?

## The Name

At Chamkaur, 40 Singhs faced a Mughal army of over 100,000. As each warrior stepped onto the battlefield, roaring "Sat Sri Akal!" before attaining Shaheedi, the Nawab was astonished. He remembered the saying: *One Singh equals Sava Lakh—125,000.*

I am no warrior. I carry no sword. But I believe that in this digital age, with Guru Ji's kirpa and AI as my shastar, even someone stumbling through their own Sikhi journey can serve with the strength of many.

That's why **125k**. That's why **CyberSingh**.

## The Problem

I'd sit at the Gurdwara, hear something beautiful—a shabad that pierced straight through—and try to find it. By the time I searched, Kirtan had moved on. The moment was gone.

I've spent decades in cybersecurity, protecting systems and solving complex problems. But this problem—connecting with Gurbani in real-time—felt more urgent than any I'd faced professionally.

## The Solution

Digital Khalsa exists to solve that problem. For me first. If it helps you, that's not my doing. That's Waheguru's kirpa.

The avatar removes my ego from this. This isn't about credentials or accomplishments. This is about Guru Ji's message reaching people who need it—starting with the one who needs it most: me.

## The Shastar

The Singhs at Chamkaur were given shastars by Guru Gobind Singh Ji before entering battle. My shastar is different—it's artificial intelligence. I may not be physically tough or spiritually advanced. But with this tool in my hands and Guru Ji's blessings on my head, I can build something that serves the Sangat.

AI doesn't make me special. It makes me *able*.

## The Mission

This isn't a business. This is seva—imperfect, stumbling seva from someone still learning what it means to be a Sikh. If Digital Khalsa helps even one person connect more deeply with Gurbani, then the shastar has done its work.

Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa. Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
