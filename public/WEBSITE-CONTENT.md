### About CybrSingh Section

**Heading**: Who's CybrSingh?

**Body**:
I'm not a guide. I'm not a teacher.
I'm just someone learning Sikhi, stumbling forward.

I built Digital Khalsa because I had a problem:
I'd sit at the Gurdwara, hear something beautiful, try to find it... and by then, Kirtan had moved on.

This app exists to solve that problem. For me.
If it helps you, that's not my doing. That's Guru Ji's kirpa.

The avatar removes my ego. This isn't about me (Vikas). It's about Waheguru's message reaching people who need it—starting with me.

## About Page (digitalkhalsa.com/about)

### Heading: Why Digital Khalsa Exists

**Body**:

I discovered Sikhi later in life. Not raised Punjabi. Learned from YouTube (Basics of Sikhi).

Every week at the Gurdwara, I'd face the same problem:
I'd hear a shabad that moved me. I'd try to remember the first few words. I'd pull out my phone, search, scroll... and by then, the Kirtani had moved on.

I kept losing beautiful moments trying to capture them.

So I built GurBani Finder. Point your camera, get the answer in 3 seconds. Stay present.

**I built this for me.** If it helps you, that's Waheguru's grace, not my code.

---

### Why "CybrSingh"?

The avatar exists to remove ego.
This isn't about me (Vikas). It's about Guru Ji's message.

I share Gurbani quotes not because you need them, but because I do.
I post reflections because I needed to hear them today.
If they resonate with you, that's kirpa. If they don't, that's my limitation.

CybrSingh is a vehicle. The wisdom is Waheguru's.

---

## Blog Post 1: Launch Announcement

### Title: Why I Built Digital Khalsa (And Launching Jan 5)

**Date**: January 1, 2026
**Author**: CybrSingh (@1cybersingh)

---

I have a confession.

I can't keep up with Kirtan at the Gurdwara.

I'll hear something beautiful—a line that hits different, words that feel like they were written for me. I'll try to remember the first few words. Pull out my phone. Open iGurbani or SearchGurbani. Type. Scroll. Search.

And by then? The Kirtani has moved on to the next pungti.

I keep losing beautiful moments trying to capture them.

---

**So I built GurBani Finder.**

Point your camera at the projector screen.
Google Vision reads the Gurmukhi.
Fuzzy matching finds the shabad in the database.
You see the full text, translation, Ang number.

All in under 3 seconds.

**I built this for me.** Because I needed it. Because I was tired of being half-present at the Gurdwara, head down in my phone, missing the Kirtan while trying to find it.

If it helps you too? That's Waheguru's grace. Not my code.

---

**Launching January 5, 2026.**

Guru Gobind Singh Ji's birthday.

I needed the deadline. Needed the reminder of what fearless service looks like. This is my attempt. Flawed, but honest.

50 beta spots. iOS first. TestFlight. If you want in, join the waitlist.

If you don't? That's fine too. This exists whether anyone uses it or not. Because I needed it.

---

**Why "CybrSingh"?**

Because this isn't about me (Vikas).

The avatar removes ego. Makes it about Guru Ji's message, not my face.

I share Gurbani quotes not because you need them, but because I do. I post reflections because I needed to hear them today. If they help you, that's kirpa. If they don't, that's my limitation.

---

**Three Phases:**

1. **GurBani Finder** (Jan 5): Identify shabads in real-time
2. **Community Connector** (Feb-Mar): Find your Sikhi buddy (peer mentorship, not teacher-student)
3. **Sangat Directory** (Q2): Gurdwaras & resources, verified by the community

All free. No ads. No subscriptions. Just Seva.

---

**Join me.**

Not because I'm a guide (I'm not).
Not because I have answers (I don't).
But because I'm learning too. And maybe we can stumble forward together.

Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa,
Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
